This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=955

This utility draws heavily from vimtip #271 and additional note 2002-07-06.
Yet it's different in one or more aspects from other tips and scripts I'm
aware off.

Features:

- de-/commtify lines in normal mode (with count) and visual mode
- use the same keys for commenting and decommenting
- language independent, you define different mappings for various languages
  and/or one comment-command for different filetypes
- simple and flexibel, to change the comment characters from '#' to '# ' e.g.,
  just change a mapping in your .vimrc, not the script
- comment-style: comments are indented like the uncommented line
- no hlsearch problem, last search pattern and .-command are preserved
- inserted comment characters are protected from further expansion
- might be adapted to other comment styles (first column comments, ...)

Example:

Commented text looks like this:

    #if uncommented:
        /* comment the line */
    <!-- else: -->
        // uncomment the
        // lines
        no comment

You would put or remove this comments (cursor on the first line), by typing:
    ,# ,* ,< 2,/
